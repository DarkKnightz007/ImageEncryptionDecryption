# Nasscom Project
# Image Encryption &amp; Decryption using Java
Created By Milan
Using Eclipse IDE.

Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a secrete code, especially to prevent unauthorized access.
For encryption, we will convert the image into a byte array and after converting it we will apply XOR operation on each value of the byte array and after performing XOR operation on each and every value of byte array will be changed. After performing the operation now we will write new data in Image due to which we are unable to open the Encrypted Image. Here are key will act as a password to Encrypt and Decrypt the Image.

Note: You can execute the given code in any IDE offline as you need an input image location from where it can load the image as you have specified in the path for encryption and decryption.
